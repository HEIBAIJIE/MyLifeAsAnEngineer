This is a peculiar ritual—you package your existential value in data and progress bars, while your boss responds with nods and hmms to your proof of survival. Every reported number seems to say: Look, I'm still alive, I'm still useful. In this office that worships efficiency, work reporting is the modern version of prayer."
22,"作为管理层的你，站在同事1面前准备表扬。权力给了你这种奇特的能力——用语言制造多巴胺。你的每一句赞美都像是在向公司的生态系统投放营养剂，让这个巨大的有机体继续运转。表扬是一种廉价的货币，但在这个缺乏认同的世界里，它却比真金白银更加珍贵。","As management, you stand before Colleague 1, ready to offer praise. Power grants you this peculiar ability—to manufacture dopamine with words. Each compliment you give is like releasing nutrients into the company's ecosystem, keeping this massive organism functioning. Praise is cheap currency, yet in this world starved of recognition, it's more precious than gold and silver."

In this chess game of office politics, praise is your queen, capable of both attack and defense. You look at Colleague 2's expectant eyes and realize humanity's craving for recognition is so primitive and intense, as irresistible as moths to flame."
24,"面对同事3，你准备施展表扬的魔法。这是一种古老的权力仪式，通过语言的炼金术将平凡的工作成果转化为闪闪发光的成就。你的话语就像是在黑暗的办公室生活中点燃的一支蜡烛，短暂但温暖。每个人都需要这样的光芒来确认自己的存在。","Facing Colleague 3, you prepare to cast the spell of praise.

Your words are like lighting a candle in the darkness of office life—brief but warm. Everyone needs such light to confirm their existence."
