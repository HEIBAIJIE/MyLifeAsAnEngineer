230,"你感到身体开始发出疲劳的信号，是时候注意休息了。你的身体比你的意识更诚实——它不会说谎，不会自欺欺人，不会假装一切都好。健康是革命的本钱，但在资本主义的语境下，你甚至怀疑自己在为谁革命。不要忽视身体的警告，因为它可能是你唯一真诚的朋友。","You feel your body starting to send fatigue signals—it's time to pay attention to rest. Your body is more honest than your consciousness—it won't lie, won't deceive itself, won't pretend everything is fine. Health is the foundation of revolution, but in a capitalist context, you even doubt who you're revolving for. Don't ignore your body's warnings, as it might be your only honest friend."
231,"极度的疲劳让你几乎无法集中注意力，身体和精神都在抗议这种过度的消耗。你的眼皮沉重如千斤顶，思维迟钝如老旧的硬盘。这是身体的罢工，一场无声的抗议。你开始理解为什么古代有酷刑叫做'不让睡觉'——这比任何物理伤害都要残酷，因为它直接攻击你的存在感。","Extreme fatigue makes it nearly impossible to concentrate; both body and mind protest this excessive consumption. Your eyelids are heavy as car jacks, your thoughts slow as an old hard drive. This is your body's strike, a silent protest. You begin to understand why ancient torture included 'sleep deprivation'—it's crueler than any physical harm because it directly attacks your sense of existence."
232,"恭喜！你的专业能力和项目贡献得到了认可，顺利晋升为职级2。新的征程开始了。你看着手机屏幕上的通知，感受着一种复杂的情绪——这是胜利吗？还是更深层的陷阱？升职意味着更多的责任，也意味着离那个曾经充满理想的自己越来越远。但银行账户不会在乎你的存在主义危机，房租也不会。","Congratulations! Your professional competence and project contributions have been recognized, successfully promoted to Level 2. A new journey begins. You look at the notification on your phone screen, feeling complex emotions—is this victory? Or a deeper trap? Promotion means more responsibility, and also means drifting further from that idealistic self you once were. But your bank account won't care about your existential crisis, and neither will the rent."
233,"再次晋升！职级3的你已经开始理解这个游戏的规则。每一次升职都像是在迷宫中找到了新的出口，但很快你发现，这只是通向更复杂迷宫的入口。你的技能在增长，经验在积累，但内心的困惑也在同步增加。也许成长的本质就是用新的问题替换旧的问题，用更高级的困惑替换简单的迷茫。","Another promotion! As Level 3, you're beginning to understand the rules of this game. Every promotion is like finding a new exit in a maze, but you quickly discover it's just an entrance to a more complex maze. Your skills are growing, experience accumulating, but inner confusion is increasing synchronously. Perhaps the essence of growth is replacing old problems with new ones, simple confusion with more sophisticated bewilderment."
234,"职级4！你已经不再是那个初入职场的青涩新人。现在的你开始拥有一些话语权，但同时也开始承担更多的责任。你发现，权力和自由是反比关系——你能够影响的事情越多，你能够选择的事情就越少。这就像是一个精心设计的陷阱：给你足够的权力让你感到重要，但不给你足够的自由让你感到快乐。","Level 4! You're no longer that green newcomer to the workplace. Now you're beginning to have some voice, but also starting to bear more responsibility. You discover that power and freedom are inversely related—the more things you can influence, the fewer things you can choose. It's like a carefully designed trap: giving you enough power to feel important, but not enough freedom to feel happy."
235,"晋升到职级5，你开始参与更高层次的决策。这种参与让你看到了公司运作的更多内幕，但知道得越多，你就越感到无力。你开始理解为什么很多高管看起来都很疲惫——不是因为工作量大，而是因为他们看到了太多无法改变的荒谬。知识有时候不是力量，而是负担。","Promoted to Level 5, you begin participating in higher-level decisions. This participation lets you see more of the company's inner workings, but the more you know, the more powerless you feel. You begin to understand why many executives look exhausted—not because of heavy workload, but because they see too much absurdity they cannot change. Sometimes knowledge isn't power, but burden."
236,"职级6的你已经成为了中层管理的一员。你发现自己处在一个尴尬的位置：对上级来说，你是执行者；对下级来说，你是决策者。但实际上，你既不能真正决策，也不能简单执行。这就是中层管理的悖论——你需要为不是你做出的决定承担责任，同时还要让别人相信这些决定是正确的。","As Level 6, you've become part of middle management. You find yourself in an awkward position: to superiors, you're an executor; to subordinates, you're a decision-maker. But in reality, you can neither truly decide nor simply execute. This is the paradox of middle management—you need to take responsibility for decisions you didn't make, while making others believe these decisions are correct."
237,"职级7！你已经开始拥有真正的影响力，但同时也开始失去真正的自我。每一个决定都需要考虑太多的因素，每一句话都需要经过深思熟虑。你开始怀念那个可以直言不讳的自己，但那个人已经被职业化的过程慢慢磨平了棱角。也许这就是成功的代价：你得到了想要的位置，但失去了想要这个位置的那个人。","Level 7! You're beginning to have real influence, but also starting to lose your real self. Every decision requires considering too many factors, every word needs careful consideration. You begin to miss that person who could speak frankly, but that person has been slowly worn smooth by the professionalization process. Perhaps this is the price of success: you get the position you wanted, but lose the person who wanted that position."
238,"职级8的高度让你看到了更广阔的视野，但也让你感受到了更深的孤独。在这个层级，你很难找到真正的朋友——每个人都可能是竞争对手，每次交流都可能是政治博弈。你开始理解为什么很多成功人士都显得那么孤独，因为成功本身就是一种隔离。当你爬得越高，能够理解你的人就越少。","The height of Level 8 gives you a broader perspective, but also makes you feel deeper loneliness. At this level, it's hard to find real friends—everyone could be a competitor, every conversation could be political maneuvering. You begin to understand why many successful people seem so lonely, because success itself is a form of isolation. The higher you climb, the fewer people can understand you."
239,"职级9！你已经接近了这个体系的顶端，但奇怪的是，你感到的不是胜利的喜悦，而是一种深深的空虚。你开始质疑这一切的意义：为了什么而奋斗？为了谁而成功？在这个高度，你终于看清了游戏的全貌，但也失去了继续游戏的热情。也许真正的智慧不是知道如何获胜，而是知道何时停止游戏。","Level 9! You're approaching the top of this system, but strangely, what you feel isn't the joy of victory, but a deep emptiness. You begin questioning the meaning of it all: what are you striving for? For whom are you succeeding? At this height, you finally see the full picture of the game, but also lose the enthusiasm to continue playing. Perhaps true wisdom isn't knowing how to win, but knowing when to stop playing."
240,"职级10！你终于到达了这个体系的巅峰，但这种成功带来的不是满足，而是一种深刻的虚无感。你俯视着整个公司，就像一个国王俯视着他的王国，但你知道这个王国建立在多少人的痛苦之上。权力的顶峰原来是如此孤独，成功的终点原来是如此空虚。你开始理解那些功成名就后选择隐退的人——不是因为他们厌倦了成功，而是因为他们看透了成功的本质。","Level 10! You've finally reached the pinnacle of this system, but this success brings not satisfaction, but profound nihilism. You look down at the entire company like a king surveying his kingdom, but you know how much suffering this kingdom is built upon. The peak of power is so lonely, the endpoint of success so empty. You begin to understand those who choose to retreat after achieving fame and fortune—not because they're tired of success, but because they see through success's essence."
