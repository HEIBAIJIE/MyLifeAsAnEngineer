166,"你感到身体开始发出疲劳的信号，是时候注意休息了。你的身体比你的意识更诚实——它不会说谎，不会自欺欺人，不会假装一切都好。健康是革命的本钱，但在资本主义的语境下，你甚至怀疑自己在为谁革命。不要忽视身体的警告，因为它可能是你唯一真诚的朋友。","You feel your body starting to send fatigue signals—it's time to pay attention to rest. Your body is more honest than your consciousness—it won't lie, won't deceive itself, won't pretend everything is fine. Health is the foundation of revolution, but in a capitalist context, you even doubt who you're revolving for. Don't ignore your body's warnings, as it might be your only honest friend."
167,"极度的疲劳让你几乎无法集中注意力，身体和精神都在抗议这种过度的消耗。你的眼皮沉重如千斤顶，思维迟钝如老旧的硬盘。这是身体的罢工，一场无声的抗议。你开始理解为什么古代有酷刑叫做'不让睡觉'——这比任何物理伤害都要残酷，因为它直接攻击你的存在感。","Extreme fatigue makes it nearly impossible to concentrate; both body and mind protest this excessive consumption. Your eyelids are heavy as car jacks, your thoughts slow as an old hard drive. This is your body's strike, a silent protest. You begin to understand why ancient torture included 'sleep deprivation'—it's crueler than any physical harm because it directly attacks your sense of existence."
168,"你的身体已经到达了极限，如果再不休息，后果将不堪设想。工作永远做不完，但身体只有一个。现在你终于理解了那些过劳死新闻背后的逻辑——不是他们不够坚强，而是系统设计得太过完美，完美到让人忘记自己还是个生物。你感觉自己站在悬崖边缘，而悬崖下面是无底的加班深渊。","Your body has reached its limit—if you don't rest now, the consequences will be unthinkable. Work is never finished, but you only have one body. Now you finally understand the logic behind those karoshi news stories—it's not that they weren't strong enough, but that the system is designed too perfectly, so perfectly that people forget they're still biological beings. You feel like you're standing on a cliff edge, with an bottomless abyss of overtime below."
169,"恭喜！你的专业能力和项目贡献得到了认可，顺利晋升为职级2。新的征程开始了。你看着手机屏幕上的通知，感受着一种复杂的情绪——这是胜利吗？还是更深层的陷阱？升职意味着更多的责任，也意味着离那个曾经充满理想的自己越来越远。但银行账户不会在乎你的存在主义危机，房租也不会。","Congratulations! Your professional competence and project contributions have been recognized, successfully promoted to Level 2. A new journey begins. You look at the notification on your phone screen, feeling complex emotions—is this victory? Or a deeper trap? Promotion means more responsibility, and also means drifting further from that idealistic self you once were. But your bank account won't care about your existential crisis, and neither will the rent."
