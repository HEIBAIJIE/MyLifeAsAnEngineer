Job-hopping—this word echoes repeatedly in your heart like a seductive song.

This inheritance gives you a peculiar satisfaction—you've finally transformed from guided to guide. But you also realize you're passing on to the next generation the very rules you once hated. It's like a virus transmission mechanism—every infected person becomes a new source of spread. You begin to wonder: is experience inheritance the continuation of wisdom, or the replication of suffering?"
524,"深夜时分，你为开源项目贡献代码。在这个被商业逻辑统治的世界里，开源精神就像是最后的乌托邦——人们无偿地分享知识，只为了让世界变得更好。你的每一行代码都是对资本主义的温和抗议，每一次提交都是对理想主义的坚持。虽然你知道这些代码最终可能被大公司免费使用，但至少在这个过程中，你找回了编程的初心。","In the deep of night, you contribute code to open source projects. In this world ruled by commercial logic, the open source spirit is like the last utopia—people freely share knowledge just to make the world better.

Knowledge on the shelves is like supermarket goods, carefully packaged and priced.

In this era pursuing practicality, philosophy is like a luxury item—it can't directly improve your work efficiency or increase your salary, but it lets you contemplate the meaning of existence in the deep of night. This book is like vitamins for the spiritual world; though the effects aren't obvious, you believe it will save your soul at some moment."

529,"你购买了按摩设备，试图用科技来缓解身体的疲劳。这台机器就像是现代生活的隐喻——我们用一种人工的方式来解决另一种人工环境造成的问题。每一次震动都在提醒你，你的身体正在为这种生活方式付出代价。但你没有选择，只能在伤害和修复之间寻找平衡，就像在毒药和解药之间寻找生存的可能。","You purchase massage equipment, trying to use technology to relieve physical fatigue. This machine is like a metaphor for modern life—we use one artificial method to solve problems caused by another artificial environment.
