1,"你踏进老板办公室的瞬间，空气凝固了。不，不是因为紧张，而是因为那台老旧的空调正在做最后的挣扎。你清了清嗓子，开始汇报今日工作进展——每个字都像是在你的简历上刻下的墓志铭。虽是例行公事，但每次交流都在微妙地决定你是继续当一颗螺丝钉，还是成为备用零件。","When you step into the boss's office, the air freezes. No, not from tension, but because that ancient air conditioner is making its final stand. You clear your throat and begin reporting today's work progress—each word like an epitaph carved on your résumé. Though routine, every exchange subtly determines whether you remain a functioning screw or become a spare part."
2,"作为职级2的你，向老板详细介绍今天的工作内容。责任在增加，薪水也在增加，但奇怪的是，你的灵魂似乎在以相同的比例缩小。你用专业的术语包装着平庸的现实，就像用昂贵的礼品盒装着一个破碎的梦想。每一个技术细节都是对青春的背叛，每一次点头都是向现实的投降。","As a Level 2 professional, you elaborate on today's work to your boss. Responsibilities are increasing, salary is growing, but strangely, your soul seems to shrink at the same rate. You wrap mediocre reality in professional terminology, like packaging a broken dream in an expensive gift box. Every technical detail is a betrayal of youth, every nod a surrender to reality."
3,"职级3的身份让你在汇报工作时更加从容，你开始理解什么是专业的沟通方式。这种从容来自于绝望的深度——当你意识到自己已经成为系统的一部分时，反抗就变得毫无意义。你的措辞精准如手术刀，切开的却是自己最后的理想主义。现在你知道了，专业就是在礼貌地描述地狱。","Your Level 3 status makes you more composed when reporting work; you're beginning to understand professional communication. This composure stems from the depth of despair—when you realize you've become part of the system, resistance becomes meaningless. Your words are precise as a scalpel, but what they cut away is your last trace of idealism. Now you know: professionalism is politely describing hell."
